## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules

firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:rules:list
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
Firestore Rules for [your-project-id]:
  - firestore.rules (deployed)
```

### 2. Update Database (if needed)
```bash
# If you have existing customers without ownerIds
# Run this migration script in Firebase Console
```

**Migration Script:**
```javascript
// Run in Firebase Console > Firestore > Query
const customers = await db.collection('customers').get();
const batch = db.batch();

customers.forEach(doc => {
  const data = doc.data();
  if (!data.ownerIds) {
    batch.update(doc.ref, {
      ownerIds: [data.userId]
    });
  }
});

await batch.commit();
console.log('Migration complete!');
```

### 3. Build and Test
```bash
# Clear cache
npx expo start --clear

# Build for iOS
npm run ios

# Build for Android
npm run android

# Or build for both
npm run start
```

### 4. Verify Installation
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Login works correctly
- [ ] Customer list loads
- [ ] Customer detail screen shows "Owners" section
- [ ] "Manage Owners" button works
- [ ] Notification permission prompt appears

### 5. Test Notifications

#### Test 1: Engagement Created
1. Device A: Create customer
2. Device A: Add Device B user as owner
3. Device A: Create engagement
4. **Expected**: Device B receives notification

#### Test 2: Status Changed
1. Device A: Change engagement status
2. **Expected**: Device B receives notification

#### Test 3: Owner Added
1. Device A: Add Device C user as owner
2. **Expected**: 
   - Device C receives "Added as owner" notification
   - Device B receives "New owner added" notification

### 6. Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch for errors
npx expo start --clear

# Check Firebase logs
firebase functions:log

# Check Expo push service
# Visit: https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/push-notifications
```

## Post-Deployment

### ✅ Verification
- [ ] All users can receive notifications
- [ ] Notifications appear correctly
- [ ] Tapping notifications navigates correctly
- [ ] Owner management works
- [ ] No permission errors in Firestore
- [ ] No crashes or errors

### ✅ User Communication
- [ ] Notify users about new features
- [ ] Provide instructions for enabling notifications
- [ ] Share documentation links

### ✅ Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor notification delivery rates
- [ ] Track user engagement with notifications
- [ ] Monitor Firestore read/write usage

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### 1. Revert Firestore Rules
```bash
# Revert to previous rules
git checkout HEAD~1 firestore.rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Revert Code
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/revert-notifications

# Revert commits
git revert <commit-hash>

# Deploy
git push origin hotfix/revert-notifications
```

### 3. Disable Notifications
```typescript
// In app/_layout.tsx, comment out:
// const token = await registerForPushNotificationsAsync();
// const listeners = setupNotificationListeners(...);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notifications not received

**Check:**
1. Physical device (not simulator)
2. Notification permissions granted
3. Internet connection active
4. Push token saved in Firestore
5. User is in customer.ownerIds array

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Add to app/_layout.tsx
console.log('Push token:', token);

// Add to notification functions
console.log('Sending to tokens:', tokens);
console.log('Notification sent:', response);
```

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Check:**
1. Firestore rules deployed
2. User authenticated
3. User in ownerIds array

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check rules
firebase firestore:rules:list

# Test rules in Firebase Console
# Firestore > Rules > Playground
```

### Issue: Owner management not working

**Check:**
1. User document exists in Firestore
2. Email is exact match (case-sensitive)
3. User has logged in at least once

**Debug:**
```typescript
// In ManageOwnersModal.tsx
console.log('Search query:', searchQuery);
console.log('Search results:', searchResults);
console.log('Current owners:', owners);
```
