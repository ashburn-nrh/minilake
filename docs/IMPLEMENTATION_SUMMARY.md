## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy updated Firestore rules
- [ ] Test on physical device (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Grant notification permissions
- [ ] Create engagement ‚Üí verify notification received
- [ ] Change engagement status ‚Üí verify notification received
- [ ] Add owner ‚Üí verify both notifications received
- [ ] Remove owner ‚Üí verify owner removed
- [ ] Tap notification ‚Üí verify navigation works
- [ ] Test with multiple devices/users

## üîß Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure `.env` has:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your-expo-project-id
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
Deploy Firestore rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3. User Document Structure
Ensure users collection has:
```typescript
{
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  expoPushTokens: string[];
  lastTokenUpdate: string;
}
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Customer Document
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email?: string;
  tags: string[];
  avatar?: string;
  lastActivity: string;
  createdAt: string;
  userId: string;           // Original creator
  ownerIds?: string[];      // NEW: Array of owner user IDs
}
```

### Engagement Document (unchanged)
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'won' | 'lost';
  lastUpdated: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Update Code**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add push notifications and multi-owner support"
   ```

2. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

3. **Test on Device**
   ```bash
   npm run ios    # or npm run android
   ```

4. **Verify Notifications**
   - Check push token is saved to Firestore
   - Test engagement notifications
   - Test owner management notifications

## üì± User Experience

### Mobile App
1. User opens app ‚Üí push token registered
2. User creates/updates engagement ‚Üí owners notified
3. User adds owner ‚Üí new owner and existing owners notified
4. User taps notification ‚Üí navigates to customers screen

### Web App (Future)
- Web push notifications can be added using Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Same notification functions can be reused
- Would require service worker setup

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Physical Device Only**: Notifications don't work in simulator/emulator
2. **Network Required**: Push notifications need internet connection
3. **Best Effort Delivery**: No guarantee of notification delivery
4. **Email Search**: Case-sensitive exact match only
5. **Single Query**: Currently queries by userId only, may need composite index for ownerIds query in future

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add notification preferences/settings
- [ ] Implement in-app notification center
- [ ] Add notification history

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Rich notifications with images
- [ ] Notification action buttons
- [ ] Batch notifications to reduce spam
- [ ] Better user search (fuzzy matching)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Email fallback for failed push
- [ ] Notification analytics
- [ ] Custom notification sounds
- [ ] Scheduled notifications

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Notifications not received
- **Solution**: Check device is physical, permissions granted, push token saved

**Issue**: Cannot find user to add as owner
- **Solution**: Ensure user has logged in at least once, email is exact match

**Issue**: Firestore permission denied
- **Solution**: Deploy updated firestore.rules

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Firestore rules
firebase firestore:rules:list

# View logs
npx expo start --clear

# Test push notification
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send \
     -d '{"to":"ExponentPushToken[...]","title":"Test","body":"Test"}'
```

## ‚ú® Summary

- ‚úÖ Engagement creation and status changes
- ‚úÖ Multi-owner customer management
- ‚úÖ Owner assignment notifications
- ‚úÖ Secure access control via Firestore rules
